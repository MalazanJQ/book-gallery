React app to display a gallery of all the books I've read since I first began recording in 2017. Includes an automatic image downloader that utilizes the Google Books API to get the book cover image of any new books added to the the master book list json file.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
